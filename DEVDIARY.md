# Development Diary Activities
Please, report your key activities in each week this assignment is running.  

# Overview
As a team, we have decided to split up the work, such that each member creates their own house in a separate file. By the end of this, we should have **4** houses in total. After completing each of our houses, we will work together to create a randomized village in the main file (`village.py`), including roads, outdoor decorations, etc.

**Week 1**

The overall focus of this week is to get everything up and running in all the member's individual setups. Additionally, members should also have started playing around with the Minecraft API to attain familiarity with using it.

Number of meetings: 4

**Three** meetings were conducted during after-class consultation times with an average duration of 1 hour. In these meetings we helped each other set everything up.

**One** meeting was also conducted on Wednesday to discuss the main system we were going to be working on (we decided on Minecraft Java Edition).

The overall focus of this week is to make sure that each member has finished creating their houses and have started working on building the village.

**Week 3**

The overall focus of this week is to finalize the village and record the video for submission before the due date.

As a group, we have decided to scrap the idea of having multiple layouts to choose from and randomizing between each of them, as it is not recommended and is not what the marking criteria is looking for. Therefore, we have moved towards having the houses and roads randomly positioned within their specific areas.
